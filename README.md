Research suggests, that across a wide range of species, time perception is directly related
to size. Which is to say, the smaller an animal is, the slower time passes. It’s related to
faster response times which lead to fast-paced lives of most small creatures. It is the
reason insects and flies have a shorter life span and flies, in particular, have a faster
reaction time which allows them to avoid being swatted easily.
Inspired by this thought of relativity, we have developed MicroGiant – a
three-dimensional game based on HTML5, with the third dimension as time. The core of
the game revolves around time and size relativity seen in our environment. That is to say,
your growth is relative to time – as you grow, things move fast; and as you shrink, they
slow down.
With nothing on your side, you have to battle out and survive against all those giant
blocks. Let's see for how long you can survive your journey through the land filled with
obstacles and keep yourself at bay in this fast-paced adventure game. Enjoy as the
difficulty increases with the duration of play till you can feel the adrenaline pumping
through your veins. With controls as simple as tap to jump and swipe to move, this game
takes a second to learn, but months to master.
